=== WHITE LABELS FOR BETTER READABILITY ===

✅ COMPLETED: Made labels white, only values are colored

CHANGES:
1. Container names now white (like "Status:")
   - "worldserver:" in white, "Up 2 hours" in green/red/yellow
   - "authserver:" in white, status in color
   - "mysql:" in white, status in color

2. Continent names now white
   - "Eastern Kingdoms" in white, "25%" in green/yellow/red
   - "Kalimdor" in white, "25%" in color
   - Only percentages show health colors

3. Level bracket names now white  
   - "1-9" in white, "10%" in green/yellow/red
   - "10-19" in white, "9%" in color
   - Only percentages show distribution health

VISUAL EXAMPLE:

Before:
  worldserver: Up 2 hours     (all green)
  Eastern Kingdoms      25%   (all green/yellow/red)
  1-9                   10%   (all green/yellow/red)

After:
  worldserver: Up 2 hours     (name white, status green)
  Eastern Kingdoms      25%   (name white, % green/yellow/red)
  1-9                   10%   (name white, % green/yellow/red)

RATIONALE:
- Matches "Status:" label style (white label, colored value)
- Easier to read - labels are consistent, only values change color
- Colors indicate health/status, not categories
- More professional appearance

  - Line 1699: Container names use `title` color (white)
  - Line 1893: Continent names use `title` color (white)
